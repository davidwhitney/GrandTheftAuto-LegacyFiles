Archive of ancient GTA content
=============================================

We've lost a lot of things from the internet of the mid to late 1990s.
When I was a young teenager, I got pretty into GTA modding and the drama / community surrounding the first Grand Theft Auto game.
The GTA series is now quite a big deal, and while clearing through some old archives, I've found a bunch of maps / tools / mods / emails from that era.  The unofficial stuff is fun, but mostly disposable, but I'm going to push this stuff all up to GitHub for posterity.

The original "CityScape Data Structure" and "GTA Mission Template Description" documents must count as some sort of historical artifact by now...

# DMA Design

* Official design documents released to the community circa ~Jan 1998

# Community

* Small archive of maps necromancied from the internet
* Couple of modding / editing utilities

Also worth noting that while all of the "old" GTA sites this side of Gouranga! are gone, as a historical document - http://gta.mendelsohn.de/ is still online, and quite a nice little snapshot of the community back in "the day".

Enjoy. And for the love of god, don't read any of the readme's that I wrote age ~14.

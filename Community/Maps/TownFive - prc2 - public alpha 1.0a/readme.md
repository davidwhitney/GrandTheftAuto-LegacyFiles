TownFive is realativly easy to get up and running. &nbsp;MAKE SURE TOWNFIVE
IS IN x:\your-gta-directory\townfive<BR>
(where x is your hard disk letter and your-gta-directory is your gta directory
(duh!)).
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">The easy way</FONT><BR>
Run the T5 bat files. &nbsp;They are t5-8bit.bat for low colour GTA. t5-24bit.bat
for High colour and t5fx.bat for 3dfx GTA.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">The hard way</FONT><BR>
Backup the files x:\your-gta-diectory\gtadata\ english.fxt, special.fxt
mission.ini
<P>
Now copy the files from the TownFive folder into x:\your-gta-directory\gtadata
and run the game replacing the backed up files when you've finished playing.

In mission 2 where you have to go and take the boss to outside the taxi station
sometimes the man you are supposed to meet isnt there and the arrow messes
around pointing in all directions. The problem here is sometimes the mission
works fine! I'm still working on this.<BR>
In deathmatch some of the powerups don't open when you drive over them but
do when you hit them or shoot them.<BR>
In mission 2 when you are driving the boss to his hidaway in the industrial
zone the game once crashed on me for an unknown reason.
<P>
The whole helicopter pickup thing in chapter 2 of TownFive and TownFive nights
doenst work yet it exits the game cos' it can't create the helicopter because
it can't make the blades appear. &nbsp;No-ones ever done this before (not
even in the full game) but I'm taking to DMA about getting it to work so
I can finish my pet GTA project with an original "bang".
<P>
The bots are stupid, can't do much about it its the games AI, therefore you
can trick them into walking into ponds e.t.c. to kill them.

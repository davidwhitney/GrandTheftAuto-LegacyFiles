This is a simple add-on pack for the GTA:London 1961 addon pack for GTA (phew
what a long title).
<P ALIGN=Left>
Installation : Unzip ALL the files you got in the .zip into you "UK" sibdirectory
of your "GTADATA" in your main "GTA" directory. &nbsp;For example is you
installed GTA into the directory "C:\GTA\" you should unzip this archive
into the directory "C:\GTA\GTADATA\UK\" (I shall use this directory for all
examples in the rest of this readme). &nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
PLEASE NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE BOTH THE Grand Theft Auto : London 1969 AND Grand
Theft Auto :London 1961 add-on packs installed for this patch to work.
<P ALIGN=Left>
How to play: To play the patch just open up your "C:\GTA\GTADATA\UK\" directory
and run the file McrCops.bat. &nbsp;This file will modify your game and then
let you choose either 8-bit low colour DOS GTA or 3DFX accelerated GTA (note
for 3DFX GTA a 3d card is required). &nbsp;If you wish to run another version
of GTA (Windows 95/98 version for example), I have provided two other 'quick
install files'. &nbsp;To play in another version of GTA first run the file
"C:\GTA\GTADATA\UK\mcr.bat". &nbsp;Now play the game. &nbsp;When you have
finished playing the game run the file "C:\GTA\GTADATA\UK\mcr2.bat" to uninstall
the patch until you next wish to use it.

What this pack actually does!!!: &nbsp;This pack lets you play, in single
player mode, the free deathmatch map base on the UK city of Manchester with
the added bonus of Police in the map. &nbsp;There is also included a work
in progress 'Drag Race' multiplayer mod. &nbsp;At the moment it crashes the
game when you launch the map after a direct or LAN connection but any help
in debugging the ini file would be welcome (if you dont understand this it
doesnt matter its not important).
<P ALIGN=Left>
Other info/'Developers info': To anyone wishing to use the modified Cops
Manchester map in their projects feel free as long as you give me credit
for the addition in the readme file, I would also like to know of the project
so I can play it myself :o). &nbsp;Debugging for the drag race multiplayer
thingy would be helpful just to save me time finding the errors!!! &nbsp;Lets
see, oh yeah GTA is a trademark of DMA the London pack(s) are tradmarks of
Rockstar Games. &nbsp;I didnt create the Manchester map just edited it. &nbsp;If
anyone at the respective companys has a problem with my work please dont
hesitate to contact me and I'll be glad to help/oblige.

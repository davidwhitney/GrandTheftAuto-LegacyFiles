Version 2</BIG></FONT>
<P ALIGN=Left>
This is the Second version of the GTA: London map modified for single player
use.<BR>
This patch contains the files:<BR>
These files are MODs that let you play the Multiplayer only Manchester map
that came free with GTA: London 1961 in single player mode with police chasing
you. &nbsp;The second MOD in the .zip lets you play the Manchester map with
police chaseing you but also has BOTS. &nbsp;BOTS are computer controlled
enemys who will try to kill you at all costs. &nbsp;To survive you must kill
them first. &nbsp;Then the next BOT with appear on the map (spawn) and will
have a bigger gun, you then have to kill it and so on.

    <TD>Updates in Version 2</TD>
    <TD>The problem which crashed the map when you got arrested has been fixed,
      in all the confusion in adding police routes I forgot to add a Police station
      respawn point!
      <P>
      The major addition of BOTS to give you a simulated deathmatch. &nbsp;Just
      run the first level and follow the arrow to your first opponent. &nbsp;The
      one problem with the BOTS at the moment is that you cannot kill them with
      bullets. &nbsp;You can run them over, set them on fire and explode them but
      you can't shoot them. &nbsp;This has been a problem with the BOT code since
      the beggining and if anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this well,
      send em' in and I'll give you a pat on the back for solving a problem which
      has caused me headaches since November 98. &nbsp;For some strange reason
      this problem doesnt occur everytime the BOT code is used just some of the
      time. &nbsp;Its baffled me this one has.
      <P>
      Better BOT accuracy from previous incarnations of the BOT. &nbsp;They are
      good shots so watch your back!</TD>

    <TD>How to install the patch</TD>
    <TD>Well first you must have: Grand Theft Auto installed, Grand Theft Auto:
      London 1969 (mission pack 1) installed, Grand Theft Auto: London 1961 (Mission
      Pack 2 (available from www.GTA-LONDON.com to anyone who owns London 1969
      for free)) installed. &nbsp;Now unzip the contents of the .zip file into
      the directory c:\'your GTA directory'\gtadata\uk\ where C is the letter of
      your Hard disc. &nbsp;Its usually C but if you do have more than one hard
      disc you'll know what I mean anyway.</TD>

    <TD>How to run the MODs</TD>
    <TD>First decide which patch you want to run the Manchester with Police mod
      (with no bots), or the Manchester with Police mod (with bots).
      <P>
      How to run the Manchester with Police mod (no bots): &nbsp;
      <P>
      To run Low-Colour DOS mode your screwed seeing as London 61 didn't come with
      an 8-bit .exe<BR>
      To run High-Colour DOS mode run the file c:\'your GTA
      directory'\gtadata\uk\McrCops24bit.bat<BR>
      To run 3DFX (3D Card required) mode run the file c:\'your GTA
      directory'\gtadata\uk\McrCops3dfx.bat
      <P>
      To run Windows GTA first run the file mcr.bat, then play the game. &nbsp;When
      you want to restore GTA: London 1961 back to normal run the file c:\'your
      GTA directory'\gtadata\uk\mcr2.bat
      <P>
      Thats it simple.
      <P>
      How to run the Manchester with Police mod (with bots): Very similar to the
      above
      <P>
      To run Low-Colour DOS mode again your screwed due to the lack of an 8-bit
      .exe<BR>
      To run High-Colour DOS mode run the file c:\'your GTA
      directory'\gtadata\uk\McrBots24bit.bat<BR>
      To run 3DFX (3D card required) mode run the file c:\'your GTA
      directory'\gtadata\uk\McrBots3dfx.bat
      <P>
      To run Windows GTA first run the file c:\'your GTA
      directory'\gtadata\uk\mcrbot.bat then play the game. When your done and want
      to restore your copy of GTA: London 1961 back to normal run the file
      c:\'your-GTA-directory'\gtadata\uk\mcr2bot.bat
      <P>
      Thats it!!!</TD>

    <TD>Notes on the patch</TD>
    <TD>This version still features the pre-release drag strip multiplayer mod
      but it is unchanged from the last version. &nbsp;I only just realised that
      GTA:L 61' doesn't have an 8-bit .exe I found that funny cos' all other GTA
      .exe's have an 8-bit version. &nbsp;It was getting me worried when I was
      writing the self launching .bats when I kept on getting the bad command file
      name error. &nbsp;Funny huh, no? &nbsp;The BOT code is still based on the
      BOT code I wrote back in November 1998 and is still more or less unchanged
      from that mould except for the fact that these bots are ever so slightly
      harder. &nbsp;You can get a&nbsp;walkthrough to codeing these BOTs at my
      site Section 487 (see bottom for URL).&nbsp;&nbsp;What ever I missed out
      of this readme would go here, I always miss something.</TD>

On 8/8/99 I modified the original ED2 mission.ini to fix the bot code. &nbsp;The
directors cut is identicle to the old ED2 except with fixed BOT code.
&nbsp;Thanks to NIck Nomland for help with the fix. &nbsp;Just play the map
like it used to. &nbsp;This readme should still be accurate.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">WTF this is : </FONT>ED2 is an addon for Grand Theft
Auto (GTA)
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">WTF do all these files do : </FONT>extreme2.cmp, this
is the city itself (or the map file).<BR>
Mission.ini, this is the file that tells the game what to do where how and
why. english.fxt &amp; specail.fxt, these are the language files that contain
all the text from the game. ed2.htm, well wtf do you think you are looking
at right now eh?
<P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">How do I run it then : </FONT>First you get yourself
a copy of GTA (but you probably already have that if you have downloaded
this!!! Now if you haven't already done so and have got this read me without
unzipping the ed2.zip file unzip the file ed2.zip into a subdirectory in
your gta directory it would go a little like this
c:\'your-gta-directory\extreme2\. Now make another sub directory called BACKUPS
(c:\'your-gta-directory'\backups\), and move the files
c:\'your-gta-dir'\gtadata\mission.ini,
<P>
c:\'your-gta-dir'\gtadata\english.fxt,
<P>
c:\'your-gta-dir'\gtadata\special.fxt,
<P>
into your newly created backups directory. Now copy the files extreme2.cmp,
mission.ini, english.fxt and special.fxt from this .zip into the
c:\'your-gta-dir'\gtadata\ directory and just run GTA as normal!!! Belive
me it sounds alot harder in text than it really is!!! When you want your
normal GTA levels and stuff back just restore your backups by copying your
backups back to you c:\'your-gta-dir'\gtadata\ directory. Its always handy
to have backups of those files anyway as they are the most important files
in the game!!!

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Background of this project : </FONT>The map Extreme
City was made my Mc' Gee and Jordan who then left the project up in the open
air. At this point the now redundant Vice City Mafia GTA internet group/clan
took on the project but did nothing for/on it. I was a member of the Vice City Mafia for about 3 1/2 weeks before
it broke up and I took it on from there making missions the ED2 BOT (The
first of its kind for GTA), and ultimatly finished this on Saturday 7th of
November 1998.

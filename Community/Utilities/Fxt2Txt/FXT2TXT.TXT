Make your own GTA Messages!

This pair of Programs converts "Grand Theft Auto"
*.FXT - Files into *.TXT Files and back.

*.FXT Files can be found in the GTADATA and GTADOS/DATA
		directories and contain the program messages
		(including pager, phone, help texts, and more).
*.TXT Files use the ISO Charset and can be viewed
		(and edited) with any Windows Editor. With luck,
		the edited files will still work with the game.

Usage Example:
	cd gta/gtadata
	copy english.fxt english.old
	fxt2txt < english.fxt > english.txt
	edit english.txt
	txt2fxt < english.txt > english.fxt
	cd ..
	gta

CAUTION: Always use "< infile" input redirection !
If you forget this by mistake, hit Ctrl-Z , then Enter to quit.

WHAT IS IT : A Liberty City only BOT for Grand Theft Auto. Other city support
will come later...
<P>
CREDITS/BY : David Whitney
<P>
CONTENTS : mission.ini, english.fxt, special.fxt, bot.bat, Importantinfo.htm
<P>
WHAT THEY DO : mission.ini is where the bots 'AI' is, special and english.fxt's
are the text from the patch (i.e. the one line 'BOTMATCH'), the Importantinfo.htm
is this file!
<P>
HOW TO USE THEM : &nbsp;Create a subdirectory in your GTA directory called
"bot"&nbsp;(without the " &amp; " of course). &nbsp;Put all the contents
of the .zip into that directory then...
<P>
Run the file bot.bat. This backs-up your original files by renaming them
: mission.day, english.day and special,day then copys the bot files. When
the game closes it changes the names back to their orignal state. Plese note
bot.bat only works if the BOT files are in the subdir
"yourdriveletter":\"your-gta-directory"\bot\.
<P>
BOT BATTLE PLAN : The BOT cycles through all available weapons, so beware
if you drive at it you might get a rocket in your face.
<P>
KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR KILLS : Pause the game and where it normally say 'Missions
Completed' it will give you a 'BOTS KILLED : number/0' The number is out
of 0 because the bots are in an unlimited cycle and will just keep on coming!!!

CHANGER SINCE VERSION 1: The problem where the bot wouldn't die if shot with
a machine gun or pistol has been resolved thanks to the testing of Nick Nomland.
&nbsp;He noticed I had the bot set up as friendly so even though it was doing
what it was told and trying to kill you, it couldn't actually follow out
the order.
<P>
The patch now has 2 difficulty levels. &nbsp;The first one is Easy the second
is hard. &nbsp;The difference is just that the bots aim improves in difficulty
level 2.
<P>
KNOWN BUGS: &nbsp;I don't know of any more bugs now!!!
<P>
THANKS: &nbsp;NIck Nomland, Schu for G! and his support over time, all the
normal people who I tend to thank and stuff (mouse, Azz et all). &nbsp;Don't
have the time for a proper thanks but if you deserve thanks you know who
you are already.
